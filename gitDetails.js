1-> GIT -> git is a version control system. and git maintain version history so we can revert to anyof previous state of your code.

2->without git Problem :-
   1. if multiple user want work on the same project so at that condition we need to send project file throught zip or pendrive etc.
   2. if we save code on local so if hard disk failure or computer crash so code will detroy.
   
   -------Command------
 3->Git clone :- it will create or copy of project into local machine.
                      git clone url
                      git clone url

                  git status
                 git status
 5-> Staging:- its area which contain the file which ready to commit.
 6-> git add . :- use to add all changes goes into staging area
                      git add .
                      git add .
  7-> git commit -m "message given by developer" :-commit the files/changes to the local repository
                    git commit -m "new functionality added"

   11-> git reset :-This means that when you want to undo the changes in multiple commits, git reset may be more useful but should mostly be used only when changes have not been made public, while git revert can be used when only a specific commit needs to be undone and can be used even when the changes have been made public.

         git revert commitId
   
   11-> undo local change :- change your local changes
                       git checkout .

   12-> undo after commit code :- we can undo the code after commit
                 git revert commitId

   13-> git branch -> check all branch name
                git branch
